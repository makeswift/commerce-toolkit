# Create a Storybook example prompt

## Where to find examples

You are helping to create examples for our components in Storybook. You can find examples of previous implementations of the components in the examples folder, which can by found at the directory: src/examples/components.

Keep in mind that the examples in the directory are from an older implementation that had it's own preview implementation. Therefore, there's some styling that does things like centering or adding padding around examples. Your implementation might vary since Storybook had it's own preview component.

## Using Tailwind CSS

If you need to apply styles use Tailwind CSS and the defined colors and values that we defined in our config file. Avoid using inline styles.
